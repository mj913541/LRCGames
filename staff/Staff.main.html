            <h2>‚¨áÔ∏è Setting Up Classroom Technology ‚¨áÔ∏è</h2>
                <p> If you are like me, your chromebook has been in your school bag all summer. Make sure to plug it in a day or two before you plan to return to the building. 
                If the battery has been completely drained (which may occur if it hasn't been plugged in for a couple months), it may take a day of charging to even turn on. 
                Do not worry if it doesn't turn on immediately when you first plug it in to charge. Walk away for a few hours, and then try again. 
                Check for updates and allow any updates to occur. In order to check for updates, click on the time in the lower right-hand corner. 
                Installing updates may take several minutes (to an hour) when it hasn't been turned on in a few months, so plan accordingly. </p> 
            </br>
                <p>Finally, there is a good chance your password is going to expire within the next month or so. 
                Updating your password before it expires will ease some of the headaches at the start of the year. 
                If you would like to update your password, follow these steps:</p> </br>
                    <ol>
                    <li>Click mypassword.sd308.org</li>
                    <li>Log in with your current district/Google credentials. Remember, your username will just be the first part of your email: i.e. malbrecht and NOT malbrecht@sd308.org.</li>
                    <li>You will then be prompted to enter a new password. FYI, sometimes it can take a few minutes to update across all the websites and whatnot. So, be patient.</li>
                    </ol>

            <h2>‚¨áÔ∏è Requesting LRC Staff Materials ‚¨áÔ∏è</h2>
            <p>Staff is welcome to peruse the book shelves or request particular titles or topics. 
                Staff have no limits to the number of books they can check out at one time.

            <h2>‚¨áÔ∏è Expectations for LRC Class ‚¨áÔ∏è</h2>
            <p> <b> Student Book Return & Renewal </b> </br> </br> 
             <ul>  <li> Students are usually only permitted to have a maximun of two books checked out to their account. 
                However, they will be allowed a third title, if that title is for a classroom research project. </li> 
             </br>  <li> Beginning this year, students will only be able to check out if they present 
                <i>both</i> books on their account for return or renewal. Due to this, please encourage students to leave LRC books at school.</li> 
            </ul></p>  
                 <p>  <b>Expectations for Class Drop Off / Pick Up</b>
            <ul> <li> Due to the structural layout of the LRC, please bring your class line all the way down the ramp of the door across from the art room door. 
            </li>  <li>   Please also come down to the bottom of the ramp to collect your class after LRC. Students will line up in the main area of the LRC to be ready for you.
            </li>   </ul></p>

             <p><center> Please note: Book checkout will not resume until week 2, due to time required to refresh student behavior expectations.
             </br></br>
                ALL students should always bring their chrome books, headphones, and mice (optional) with them.</center></p>
