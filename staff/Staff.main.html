            <h2>⬇️ Setting Up Classroom Technology ⬇️</h2>
            <p> Every room should receive a plastic gallon bag with tech items inside. 
                The black item in the lower right hand corner of the sheet is the dongle that connects your chromebook to the extra monitor and/or the projector.  This video, although a bit longer than you’re used to, explains the entire set up for this tool. If you still need help setting up your classroom after watching, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me.  I can also help you set up phone hard lines if they were disconnected over the summer.
            </br>
            </br>
                If you are like me, your chromebook has been in your school bag all summer. Make sure to plug it in a day or two before you plan to return to the building. If the battery has been completely drained (which may occur if it hasn't been plugged in for a couple months), it may take a day of charging to even turn on. Do not worry if it doesn't turn on immediately when you first plug it in to charge. Walk away for a few hours, and then try again. 
                Check for updates and allow any updates to occur. In order to check for updates, click on the time in the lower right-hand corner. Installing updates may take several minutes (to an hour) when it hasn't been turned on in a few months, so plan accordingly. 
            </br>
            </br>
                Finally, there is a good chance your password is going to expire within the next month or so. Updating your password before it expires will ease some of the headaches at the start of the year. If you would like to update your password, follow these steps:  
                <ol>
                    <li>Click mypassword.sd308.org</li>
                    <li>Log in with your current district/Google credentials. Remember, your username will just be the first part of your email: i.e. malbrecht and NOT malbrecht@sd308.org.</li>
                    <li>You will then be prompted to enter a new password. FYI, sometimes it can take a few minutes to update across all the websites and whatnot. So, be patient.</li>
                </ol>

            <h2>⬇️ Expectations for LRC Class ⬇️</h2>
            <p>Student Book Return & Renewal
                While students are usually only permitted to have two books checked out to their account, they will be allowed a third title, if that title is for a classroom research project. 
               On your book collection day, please have students put their books in the LRC cart and bring it down to the LRC during book collection times. Two students should bring down the cart and transfer their classroom’s books to the grade level book return box. They will then take the cart to the next teacher in the grade level. (noted on cart)
               If students do not turn their books into the cart, please have them keep them on their person and bring them down on their way to LRC class. 
               If a student wishes to RENEW their book, they should put a post-it on the front cover. If they are able, please have them write their name on the post-it. These books do not need to be separated any further from the other returns. 
               Book Collection Days:
               A: Basic, Cavello
               B: Day, Adams, Brandwein, Rosenthal
               C: Pulsa, R/W, Schmidt, Tomter
               D: Daleiden
               E: Carroll, Harrison, Peterson, Ewalt
               Expectations for Class Drop Off / Pick Up
               Due to the structural layout of the LRC, please bring your class line all the way down the ramp of the door across from the art room door. Please also come down to the bottom of the ramp to collect your class after LRC. Students will line up in the main area of the LRC to be ready for you. :)
               Please note: Book checkout will not resume until week 2, due to time required to refresh student behavior expectations.
               ALL students should always bring their chrome books and headphones with them.</p>
