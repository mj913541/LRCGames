        <h1>Meet Mrs. Mindy Albrecht</h1>
        <p>I am thrilled to return to District 308 as your child’s teacher in the Learning Center this year!</p>
        
        <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <p>Several years ago, I served as the Head Teacher in a Montessori Lower Elementary classroom, where I had the pleasure of working with a diverse group of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd graders. For the past five years, I have been teaching math, language arts, and science at the junior high level, including a rewarding stint as an assistant at Plank Junior High. My passion for reading and continuous learning inspired me to pursue a master’s degree in Information Science and Technology from the University of Illinois—because it’s never too late to learn something new!</p>
        
        <p>I currently reside in Warrenville with my husband, Dan. Growing up in east Aurora, near Montgomery, it’s wonderful to have the opportunity to give back to the community where I grew up. Outside of school, Dan and I enjoy hiking, working out, reading, spending time with friends and family, and watching movies.</p>
